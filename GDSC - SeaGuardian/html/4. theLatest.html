                <h3>Marine pollution is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land sources and
                    is washed or blown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage to the environment, to the
                    health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide.</h3>
                Common man-made pollutants that reach the ocean include pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, detergents,
                oil, industrial chemicals, and sewage</p>
            </div>

                <p>Plastic is one of the most enduring materials man has created. Nowadays, we all know that it can take
                    hundreds of years for plastic to degrade, and research is showing that it is possible that it does
                    not even fully degrade, but becomes what we call microplastic.
                    Microplastics are tiny particles of plastic that can be eaten by marine animals and end up in their
                    bodies and tissues, entering the food chain and leading to disastrous consequences for the health of
                    our planet and all its inhabitants.</p>

                <p>Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land. One of the biggest sources
                    is called nonpoint source pollution, which occurs as a result of runoff. Nonpoint source pollution
                    includes many small sources, like septic tanks, cars, trucks, and boats, plus larger sources, such
                    as farms, ranches, and forest areas. Millions of motor vehicle engines drop small amounts of oil
                    each day onto roads and parking lots. Much of this, too, makes its way to the sea.
                    Some water pollution actually starts as air pollution, which settles into waterways and oceans. Dirt
                    can be a pollutant. Top soil or silt from fields or construction sites can run off into waterways,
                    harming fish and wildlife habitats.</p>

            <h2><b>How Much Plastic Is in The Ocean Now?</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>There is an estimated 75 to 199 million tons of plastic waste currently in our oceans, with a further 33
                billion pounds of plastic entering the marine environment every single year. This constant flow of
                plastic production is simply too much for existing waste management and recycling infrastructure.
                Plastic pollution permeates every inch of the ocean from microplastics in the food chain to plastic
                water bottles floating on the surface. One of the most famous examples, however, is the Great Pacific
                Garbage Patch. This monolith of ocean pollution is made up of all kinds of marine debris and contains
                1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, covering an area twice the size of Texas.
            </p>
            <h2><b>How Much Plastic Do We Produce Each Year?</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Plastic is only a relatively new invention, appearing in the early 20th century. However, since its
                inception, the production of plastic has grown exponentially from 2 million tonnes per year in 1950 to
                460 million metric tons in 2019.
                Thats a combined 9.5 billion metric tons of plastic from 1950 to 2019, of which approximately 7 billion
                metric ton has already become waste. Its not so surprising considering up to 50% of all plastics
                produced each year are made as single-use products.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Which Country Produces the Most Plastic Waste?</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Measuring which country produces the most plastic waste is not as easy as it sounds, but 2010 data on
                per capita waste placed Kuwait at the top, with 0.69 kg per person, per day. This was followed by
                Antigua and Barbuda (0.66 kg), Saint Kitts and Nevis (0.65 kg), and Guyana (0.59 kg). The United States
                ranked 15th at 0.34 kg per person, per day.
                However, when it comes to total plastic waste generated, it's a different picture, with China standing
                out with 59,079,741 metric tons, followed by the United States (37,825,550 t), Germany (14,476,561 t),
                Brazil (11,852,055 t), and Japan (7,993,489 t).
                However, the largest amount of plastic waste does not necessarily translate to the biggest producer of
                plastic pollution. Data from 2019 on countries' shares of global plastic waste in the oceans put The
                Philippines in the top spot, with more than 36% of global input, followed by India (12.92%), Malaysia
                (7.46%), China (7.22%), and Indonesia (5.75%). At the same time, that doesn't necessarily mean that the
                plastic waste originated in those countries - until 2017, China was importing millions of tons of
                plastic every year from western nations.
            </p>
            <h1>What Is the World Doing to Stop Ocean Plastic Pollution?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>It's clear that plastic pollution continues to be a very serious problem and that the oceans are
                increasingly at risk but what are people doing to stop it and how is innovation helping to combat this
                tricky yet pervasive issue?
                There are numerous initiatives to curb ocean plastic pollution at any one time, including everything
                from grassroots beach clean-ups to international agreements. One of the recent changes is the United
                Nations Environment Assembly's agreement in March 2022 to develop a legally binding treaty to bring
                plastic pollution to an end. It will still be years in the making but is a considerable step forward
                according to many.
                What's more, many organizations, such as Ocean Conservancy, are now calling for more dramatic changes to
                stop ocean plastic pollution, such as the reduction in production and consumption as well as outright
                bans on single-use plastics. Many are calling for a shift to a zero-waste circular economy as the only
                solution to a plastic problem that we can't recycle away. </p>
